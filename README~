This repository contains multiple python programs that use different machine learning algorithms on the kaggle Titanic competition. The data set for this competition contains missing entries. Most of the preprocessing involves filling in these missing values.

The training and test data sets are also in the repository in case you wanted to try out the code.

titanicRF.py uses Random Forests

titanicSVM.py uses Support Vector Machines

titanicGB.py uses Gradient Tree Boosting

utils.py contains functions used by all programs above
